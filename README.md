# coin-puzzles

At work we have #puzzles. Someone posted:

> Consider a chessboard that is infinite upward and to the right (but has a left and a bottom edge). We start with coins in the three most bottom-left positions, that is, (0, 0), (1, 0), and (0, 1). The goal of this game is to get that small region completely free of coins. If a coin has empty squares to the right and upward, you may remove that coin and place two new squares in the rightward and upward squares. Can you get the original region of coins completely empty?

I was intrigued which is where this little thing came from.

## To run it

`npm install && npm start`

Then click on the circle/coin to remove.
